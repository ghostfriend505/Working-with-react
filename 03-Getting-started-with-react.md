<h1> Let's Learn React Js</h1>

<h3>What is React Js? </h3>

  React.js is an open-source JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces specifically
  for single-page applications. It's used for handling the view layer for web and mobile apps.
  React also allows us to create reusable UI components, React was first created by Jordan Walke, 
  who was a software engineer working for Facebook. 

  React allows developers to create large web applications that can change data without reloading the page.
  The primary purpose of React is to be fast, and straightforward.

  React Js is also called simply React or React.Js

<h3> What are the React.js Features? </h3>

  Let us take a closer look at features of React.

  React.Js is Easy to Learn, Simple, Component-bases, declarative. extensive, fast etc..

<h3>JSX </h3>

  In React, insted of using regular JavaScript, it uses JSX. JSX is a simple JavaScript that allows HTML 
  quoting and uses HTML tags syntax to render components. HTML syntax is processed into JacaScript calls of
  React FrameWork.

<h3>React Native </h3>

  React-native is a mobile apps building framework using Javascript, It uses the same desing as React, letting 
  you include a rich mobile UI library comoponents. The best part of using react-native is to allow components 
  written in Objective-C,java or Swift.

<h3>Single-Way data flow</h3>

In React, one-way data flow refers to the movement of data from parent components to child 
components through props. This one way flow of data ensures that state and logic are
centralized in parent components, while child components focus on rendering and presentation.
Any update from child to parent components are achived using callback functions.
  
<h3> Virtual Document Object Model </h3>

React creates an in-memory data structure cache that computes the changes made and then update 
the browser. This is a unique feature that allows programmers to code as if the whole page is 
rendered on each time, but react library only renders components that changes.

<h3> Why React Js is popular?</h3>

React is efficient and flexible open-source JavaScript library for building simple, fast and 
scalable fronted of web appications.
