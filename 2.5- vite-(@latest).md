## What is Vite?

**Vite** (pronounced *veet*) is a modern build tool used to create fast React applications.  
It is developed by **Evan You** (creator of Vue.js) and is now the **recommended way** to start new React projects.

Vite focuses on:
-  speed
-  simplicity
-  modern development

---

## Why We Should Use Vite Now

Earlier, we used **Create React App (CRA)**, but it is now slow and outdated.

Vite is better because:

- ⚡ Super fast startup
- 🔥 Instant hot reload
- 📦 Smaller bundle size
- 🧹 Clean project structure
- 🚀 Uses modern ES modules
- ❌ No unnecessary config
- ✅ Industry standard (2024+)

## How to Create a React App Using Vite

    npm create vite@latest my-app
    cd my-app
    npm install
    npm run dev

### After running this, open browser and go to:

    https://localhost:5173

  Your app will run instantly 


## Simple Vite Projext Structure 

    my-app/
    ├── index.html
    ├── src/
    │    ├── main.jsx
    │    ├── App.jsx
    │    └── assets/
    ├── package.json
    └── vite.config.js

  ### Important files:

  - main.jsx -> entry point
  - App.jsx -> main component
  - vite.config.js -> Vite configuration


## Example Code (Vite React App)

- main.jsx

      import React from 'react'
      import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
      import App from './App'

      ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render (
      <App />
      )

- App.jsx

      function App () {
      return <h1> Hello from Vite </h1>
      }
      export default App


# Difference Between CRA and Vite

      Feature            Create React App              Vite

      Speed                 Slow                      Very fast
      Startup time          10-20 sec                 1-2 sec
      Hot relod             slow                      instant
      Mordern Js            Limited                   Full Support

      Status                Deprecated                Recommended


## Vite Side Panel Explanation (Terminal)

When you run   

      npm run dev

You will see:

    ->  Local: https://localhost:5173/
    ->  Network: use --host to expose 
    ->  press h to show help

Meaning 

- Local -> app URL
- Network -> for mobile testing
- h -> help menu
- q -> quite server
- r -> restart server


### Why Vite is the Future

- Used by React, Vue, Svelte developers
- Recommended by React community
- Used in real-world production apps
- Perfect for beginners and professionals

  
## How Much Code Difference Is There Between CRA and Vite?

One of the biggest advantages of Vite is that it uses **less code and fewer files**
compared to Create React App (CRA).

---

### Create React App (CRA) – More Code
CRA creates many files that beginners don’t need at start.

Example:

    src/
    ├── index.js
    ├── App.js
    ├── App.css
    ├── index.css
    ├── logo.svg
    ├── reportWebVitals.js
    ├── setupTests.js
    └── App.test.js

You don't really understand most of these at the beginning 

--- 

### Vite - Less Code, Clean Setup 

Vite gives only the important files.

Example:

    src/
    ├── main.jsx
    ├── App.jsx
    └── assets/

That's it. Clean and Somple

---

### Entry File Difference 

#### CRA 

      import React from 'react'
      import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
      import App from './App'
      import './index.css'

      ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render (
        <React.StrictMode>
          <App />
        </React.StrictMode>
      )

#### Vite

      import React from 'react'
      import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
      import App from './App'
      import './App.css'

      ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render (
          <App />
      )

  - Less code
  - Less confusion
  - East to understand
